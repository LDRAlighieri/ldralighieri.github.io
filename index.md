I'm Vladimir **LDRAlighieri** Raupov, a software developer from Khabarovsk, Russia. I mainly develop applications for Android and iOS and useful libraries to speed up development.
Unfortunately you will not find all my projects on this site, only a small part of them. Most of the projects that I have done in recent years have been commercial and I have no right to open source code.

But I can show those projects that I created for personal use and for the community.

**Thank you**.
